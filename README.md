### Pycon Canada Demo Jupyter Notebook 🐍 🇨🇦

### What is this?
- This jupyter notebook outlines a few Python libraries, RDFLIB, SPARQLWrapper and ontospy which can be used to navigate linkedin data. 
- In this talk we outline a variety of uses for linked data as well as graph databases. 

### Why is this important?
- Our entire world wide web already is composed of linked data. In this talk we demonstrated how python module RDFlib is able to traverse and parse linked data.
- Linked data is queried with a query language called SPARQL which is supported by the RDFlib library. We will also show you how to level up your data insights by introducing graph databases. 
- This talk allows you to draw relationships out of open linked data, as well as the unique value of communicating the relationships from linked data.
